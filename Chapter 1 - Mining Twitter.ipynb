If you are running the code from your own development envioronment, however, be advised that these examples in this chapter take advantage of a Python package called [twitter](https://github.com/sixohsix/twitter) to make API calls. You can install this package in a terminal with [pip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip) with the command `pip install twitter`, preferably from within a [Python virtual environment](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv).
